                <h2>Top 5 knocks of Jos Buttler in IPL</h2>
                <p>Destruction, power, elegance – these three words can be associated with a batter like Jos Buttler.
                     Jos the Boss, as he is so fondly called, has played some wonderful knocks in his career. Playing for Rajasthan Royals in the IPL, Butler has made the fans go wow with his power-hitting and some of his knocks have just been brilliant. 
                    Not only in the IPL, Jos is one player who has done well in the international circuit as well. 
                    Here though, we look at Buttler’s top 5 knocks while playing for Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League.
                     Here we go…</p>

                  <h4>1. 124 off 64 balls against Sunrisers Hyderabad (IPL 2021) - </h4>
                  <p>This was Jos Buttler’s first hundred in T20s and it was not easy for him. 
                      He was struggling for form throughout the season and even at the start of this innings, he was struggling against the likes of Rashid Khan. 
                      At one stage, he was around 30 off 30 deliveries, a strike rate of just 100 which is not usually associated with Buttler.
                       But once he got his eye in, we saw a Buttler who was invincible. From a slow start, he finished with 124 off just 64 balls to help Rajasthan reach a score of over 200. Terrific stuff!

                  <h4>2. 95* off 60 balls against Chennai Super Kings (IPL 2018) - </h4>
                  <p>This was Buttler’s first season with the Rajasthan Royals and he had a brilliant season, scoring over 500 runs while opening the batting. One knock I remember from that season was against the comeback men, Chennai Super Kings. Chasing 177, Buttler got off to a rollicking start but Rajasthan lost quick wickets with Jos holding one end. The game started to slip away but Buttler kept his calm and took Rajasthan home in the last over.</p>

                  <h4>3. 94* off 53 balls against Mumbai Indians (IPL 2018) – </h4>
                  <p>2018 was a season where Jos Buttler kept on scoring runs for fun and this game was no different. Playing against his old team, Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede Stadium, Jos Buttler showed his class yet again. Rajasthan needed 169 runs to win which was not going to be easy against a bowling line-up of Mumbai. Jos though had other plans as he came out all guns blazing. Whoever bowled faced the wrath of Jos the Boss as he tonked them out of the park with ease. Because of his 94 runs, Rajasthan chased the score down with 2 overs to spare.</p>

                  <h4>4. 89 off 43 balls against Mumbai Indians (IPL 2019) – </h4>
                  <p>Jos Buttler loves playing against the Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede, doesn’t he? If his 94 in 2018 was terrific, this was even better. Rajasthan were chasing once again and they needed 188 to win. Buttler was in the mood though as he just blasted the bowling. The fans were witness to one of the finest knocks that Buttler has played and the audacity with which he hit his shots was just amazing to see. More innings like this please, Jos!</p>

                  <h4> 5. 70* off 48 balls against Chennai Super Kings (IPL 2020) – </h4>
                  <p>Another day, another fine knock from the Englishman. This innings has to be one of his best, considering the situation it was played in. Rajasthan bowled extremely well to restrict Chennai to a modest total of 125. Rajasthan in reply, lost three wickets for just 28 runs. That is when Buttler came to the fore. He started slowly, got his eyes in and then opened his shoulders. He timed his attack perfectly and got his side home. A brilliant knock from one of the best in the business!
                     <br> These are just some of the knocks that Jos Buttler has played in his IPL career so far. With IPL 2022 coming soon, Buttler will be expected to play some fine knocks again. He had a terrific T20 World Cup and he would want to carry that form in the IPL as well. Hope to see some fireworks from Jos the Boss.</p>
